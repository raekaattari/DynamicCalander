Creative Portion: 
    1. Users are able to select a tag they would like their event to identtify by only when adding the new event. Once it is added to the table, the users can then toggle the view of the events on the calendar by the tag that was attributed to them. They can choose from work, home, school, and fun. Once they click on the checkbox for one of them at a time, the calendar updates to only show the events that were tagged with that specific tag when the user created the event. 

    2. Users are able to share their events with another user through a share function. These events will not only hsow up on their calendar but also the calendar of the person they shared it with.

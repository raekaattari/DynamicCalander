Things to note: Our fields for when a new user registers and create events are not clearing, as everything we tried to do to get it to clear casued the calendar not to print. However, YOU CAN REGISTER NEW USERS. The command line will let you know that user was added and you can immediately log in. New events are also being added, you just need to hit the previous or next month button. (sorry, everything we tried was breaking our code)

Creative Portion: 
    
    1. Users are able to select a tag they would like their event to identify by only when adding the new event. Once it is added to the calendar, the users can then toggle the view of the type of events on the calendar by the tag attributed to them. They can choose from work, home, school, and fun. Once they click on the checkbox one of them at a time, the calendar updates to only show the events that were tagged with that specific tag when the user created the event. 

    2. Users are able to share their events with another user through a share function. These events will not only show up on their calendar but also the calendar of the person they shared it with. 
    
    3. Users can share events that are tagged, and both their calendar and the calendar of the user they are sharing it to will reflect that tag. 
    
    4. When a user deletes a event that is shared it only deletes in their calendar, not the calendar of another individual who also has that shared event.

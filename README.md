    1. Users are able to select a tag they would like their event to identify by only when adding the new event. Once it is added to the calendar, the users can then toggle the view of the type of events on the calendar by the tag attributed to them. They can choose from work, home, school, and fun. Once they click on the checkbox one of them at a time, the calendar updates to only show the events that were tagged with that specific tag when the user created the event. 

    2. Users are able to share their events with another user through a share function. These events will not only show up on their calendar but also the calendar of the person they shared it with. 
    
    3. Users can share events that are tagged, and both their calendar and the calendar of the user they are sharing it to will reflect that tag. 
    
    4. When a user deletes a event that is shared it only deletes in their calendar, not the calendar of another individual who also has that shared event.
